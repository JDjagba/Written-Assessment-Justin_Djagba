# Introduction

Climate change poses significant challenges to agricultural productivity, particularly in regions heavily reliant on rain-fed agriculture. Understanding the relationship between climate hazards and crop production is critical for developing adaptation strategies. This report analyzes the impact of climate hazards on sub-national crop production in India using a combination of crop production data and climate indicators.

The study aims to:

- Explore crop production trends (1947-2014)
- Calculate a climate hazard indicator
- Analyze its relationship with crop yields
- Provide insights using statistical modeling and visualization

# Plot the distribution of yield by category
ggplot(data, aes(x = category, y = yield, fill = category)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Yield Distribution by Crop Category",
       x = "Category",
       y = "Yield",
       fill = "Category") +
  theme_minimal() +

# Climate Hazard Indicators

Assessing the impact of climate on crop production involves monitoring various climate indicators. For instance, temperature and precipitation are traditional climate indicators used to assess agricultural impacts. Their effects can be complex and region-specific. The increased temperatures accelerate evapotranspiration, which leads to water stress. The changes in precipitation patterns result in droughts or floods, both adversely affecting crop production (Toté et al. 2015; Dembélé and Zwart 2016).

## Calculation of a Climate Hazard Indicator: Precipitation Extremes

To calculate a climate hazard indicator such as **Precipitation Extremes** (e.g., heavy rainfall, droughts), the following steps are required:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect historical rainfall data (e.g., monthly precipitation totals) and flood data from freely available datasets such as:
     - NOAA
     - CHIRPS
     - FEWS NET
     - IMD (for India, the study country) (KC et al. 2015).

2. **Risk Level Assignment**:
   - Assign a risk level for each hazard variable based on its historical data:
     - Low
     - Medium
     - High
     - Very High

3. **Weighting Hazard Variables**:
   - Weight the hazard variables based on their relative importance.

4. **Climate Hazard Indicator (CHI) Calculation**:
   - Calculate the Climate Hazard Indicator (CHI) using the formula:

     \[
     CHI = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (W_i \times H_i)
     \]

     Where:
     - \( W_i \) is the weight assigned to each hazard variable \( i \),
     - \( H_i \) is the risk level (1 to 4) for that hazard variable.

5. **Interpretation of Results**:
   - A higher CHI score indicates a greater level of climate hazard for a region. Regions can be categorized based on their CHI scores:
     - **Low risk**: \( CHI < 10 \)
     - **Moderate risk**: \( 10 \leq CHI < 20 \)
     - **High risk**: \( CHI \geq 20 \)



# Modeling and Analysis
## Problem Definition

•	Perform statistical analysis to understand the relationship between the climate hazard indicator(s) and crop production at the sub-national level.

The goal is to predict crop yield based on:

- **Climate variables**: Consecutive dry days (CDD), cumulative rainfall, temperature extremes, etc.
- **Crop-specific variables**: Crop type, cultivated area, region, etc.



## Methodology and Simulation Models for Yield Prediction Based on Climate and Agricultural Variables

Before diving into the methodology and models, it’s important to note that **all data must be properly prepared**. This includes cleaning, handling missing values, aggregating climate data (e.g., monthly averages), and creating derived variables such as rainfall anomalies, temperature extremes, and drought indices. Once the data is ready, we can proceed with the analysis and modeling.

---

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Preparation

#### **Data Sources**:
- **Agricultural Data**: Collect data on area under cultivation, production, and yield from reliable sources such as government agricultural departments or FAO.
- **Climate Data**: Gather historical data on minimum temperature (MinTemp), maximum temperature (MaxTemp), and rainfall from meteorological departments or platforms like NOAA, CHIRPS, or IMD.
- **Extreme Events Data**: Obtain data on heavy rainfall and droughts from disaster management agencies or satellite-based platforms.

#### **Data Preparation**:
- Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Aggregate climate data to a suitable temporal scale (e.g., monthly averages for temperature, total monthly rainfall).
- Create derived variables such as:
  - **Rainfall Anomalies**: Deviation from long-term averages.
  - **Temperature Extremes**: Number of days exceeding a threshold (e.g., days with MaxTemp > 35°C).
  - **Drought Index**: Use standardized precipitation index (SPI) or other drought indices.
  
---

## Model Selection

Several models can be used to simulate yield based on the variables. Below, we focus on **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

---

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Description**: Simple and interpretable. Models linear relationships between yield and predictors.
- **Equation**:
  \[
  Yield = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot Area + \beta_2 \cdot MinTemp + \beta_3 \cdot MaxTemp + \beta_4 \cdot Rainfall + \epsilon
  \]
  Where:
  - \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept,
  - \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4 \) are coefficients,
  - \( \epsilon \) is the error term.

---

### 2. Random Forest
- **Description**: Handles non-linear relationships and interactions. Robust to outliers and missing data.
- **Equation**:
  \[
  Yield = f(Area,Production , MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall)
  \]
  Where \( f \) is a non-linear function learned by the random forest.

---

### 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Description**: Effective for high-dimensional data. Can model complex relationships using kernel functions.
- **Equation**:
  \[
  Yield = f_{SVM}(Area,Production, MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall)
  \]
  Where \( f_{SVM} \) is a function learned by the SVM, often using a kernel (e.g., linear, radial basis function).

---

| **Random Forest**      | Handles non-linearities, robust        | Less interpretable                      | Complex, non-linear relationships       |
| **SVM**                | Effective for high-dimensional data    | Computationally expensive               | High-dimensional data                   |

# Unified Model Calibration Methodology

Model calibration involves tuning model parameters and validating performance to ensure accurate predictions. Below is a unified methodology for calibrating **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

- **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- **Normalize Data**: Scale numerical variables (e.g., using `scale()` in R) to ensure consistent performance across models.

### 2. Thematic mapping and Model Training
- **Thematic yield** maps per crop and per decade introduction, and interpretation.
- **Linear Regression**: Fit the model using the training data and estimate coefficients.
- **Random Forest**: Train the model using the training data and tune hyperparameters (`ntree`, `mtry`).
- **SVM**: Train the model using the training data and tune hyperparameters (`C`, `gamma`, kernel type).

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use **cross-validation** or **grid search** to find the optimal hyperparameters for Random Forest and SVM (Hastie et al., 2009).
- For Linear Regression, no hyperparameter tuning is required, but feature selection can improve performance. (Challinor et al., 2018; Djagba et al;,2018 )

### 4. Model Validation
- Evaluate the model on the testing set using metrics like **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²**.(Chai et al;,2014)
- Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.

### 5. Final Model Selection
- Choose the model with the best performance on the testing set.
- Retrain the selected model on the full dataset (training + testing) for deployment.
